# Summary
In this directory, you can find the weekly homework for the course. The topics covered in these exercises are as follows:
## Exercise 1 -- Linear Stability and Quasi-Static Approximation
**Goal**: Analytically study the linear stability of the stationary states of the logistic equation; study the quasi-stationary approximation for a simple, abiotic consumer-resource model. Compare these results with simulations. <br>
**Content**: A `.py` script called `LinearStability_simulations.py` containing the script for the simulations, a `.ipynb` notebook called `LinearStability_notebook.ipynb` containing the same functions and the same code as the `.py` file, with some additional notes, and a `.pdf` file called `LinearStability.pdf`, containing some analytical derivations and the actual calculations for the exercise. <br>
**Requirements**: `numpy` (ver. 1.26.0+), `matplotlib` (ver. 3.8.0+)

## Exercise 2 -- Species Area Relationship (SAR) and Endemic Area Relationship (EAR)
**Goal**: Plot the SAR and EAR curves and fit the SAR curve with a power law.
**Content**: A `.py` script called `SpeciesAreaRelationship.py` containing the script to plot the functions and a `.ipynb` notebook called `SpeciesAreaRelationship_notebook.ipynb` containing the same functions, with some additional notes. <br>
**Requirements**: `numpy` (ver. 1.26.0+), `matplotlib` (ver. 3.8.0+), `scipy` (ver. 1.11.1+)
